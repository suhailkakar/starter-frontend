### Configuration

This starter is pre-configured to work with example contracts deployed on the TAC testnet. The contract addresses are defined in lib/constants.ts:
```tsx
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = {
    SIMPLE_MESSAGE: "0x474a33F40232bdF188D46E016ad36F517Be91Bc3",
    MESSAGE_PROXY: "0x63b9E4DAc2615104DfE0d72AC593285114aeF8cc",
    CROSS_CHAIN_LAYER: "0xAd2fBeB7CE5f6e4F9C21090C7e4018081f4b323d",
} as const;
```

If you've deployed your own contracts, update these addresses accordingly.
